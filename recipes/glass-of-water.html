        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Before you get to the fancy things, you have to master the basics. And where better to start than with the most important part of everyone's diet - water? And no, this is not a joke. You'd be surprised of the intricacies of this deceptively simple recipe. Makes 10 servings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water</strong> - tap, bottle, thawed from glacial ice, or filtered from your own bodily liquids - <em>dealer's choice</em>, as we say back in Kirzigstan.</li>
                <li><strong>Ice Cubes</strong> - a little something for the senses to enjoy. And in case you're worrying about your water being cold, we'll boil it down anyway.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Pepper</strong> - oh you think it's a game? We do things the correct way here. You'll see. You'll all see.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide</strong> - completely optional, but just in case you have some lying about, you can always add it for that extra <em>pizazz</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour 2 liters of water of your choice into a pot.</li>
                <li>Add in a handful of ice cubes to taste.</li>
                <li>Turn heat to high and bring water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle in a <em>little</em> bit of black pepper for that kick that'll get you going.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat off.</li>
                <li>(Optional) This is the part where you add Carbon Dioxide if you have any lying around. Just make sure to not use <em>monoxide</em>. That's a mistake you don't want to make.</li>
                <li>Funnel into glasses and serve lukewarm.</li>
            </ol>

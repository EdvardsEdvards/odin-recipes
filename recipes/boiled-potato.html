        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>It seems simple - <em>doesn't it</em>? Just some boiled potatoes. Well, <strong>you're wrong</strong>. This recipe is forged in blood. Generation upon generation have fought to keep this recipe safe. My bloodline have protected this recipe, and now, my squire, I shall pass this knowledge on to you. Anyway, here's the recipe:</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1kg Potatoes</strong> - any variety you can get your grubby hands on.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsalted Butter</strong> - salted butter is for the poor, the unfortunate, or the stupid. If you're reading this, luckily, you're none of these.</li>
                <li><strong>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</strong> - yes, you read that right. Just one fat is not enough. To truly experience the potatoes the way the gods do, we need to go further. </li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong> - a potato without salt is akin to an angel without its wings.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Pepper</strong> - the dynamic duo. Whilst salt shines in the spotlight, black pepper's always there doing the REAL work to make sure the forces of magic are in balance.</li>
                <li><strong>Parsley</strong> - ah, the ingredient to truly separate these potatoes from those of the common-folk. If you do not like it, I'm sorry to say, but nothing great shall ever come of you.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and scrub potatoes and cut larger potatoes in halves or even quarters so the potato pieces are even-sized.</li>
                <li>Place potatoes in a pot of water with 15g of salt and cover with 2.6cm of water (Not a drop more or fewer, lest you're ready to face the consequences). Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are fork tender (10-18 minutes depending on size).</li>
                <li>Drain potatoes and return them to the pot, or a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Drizzle melted butter (figure out how to melt it yourself - it's part of the task) and olive oil over potatoes. </li>
                <li>Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Garnish with a feeshly chopped parsley and toss to combine. Keep covered until ready to serve.</li>

            </ol>
